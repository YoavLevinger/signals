Your task is to **visually examine the drawing** and **evaluate each indicator independently**.
Base your judgment solely on **visual evidence** (composition, color, proportion, and expression).
Do not speculate about emotion or intent — evaluate what is *seen*.

For each indicator, respond with **exactly one** of the following options:

* **YES** – the indicator is clearly and visually present.
* **NO** – the indicator is clearly and visually absent.
* **UNCLEAR** – the visual evidence is ambiguous or partially present.
* **SKIP** – the element does not appear in the drawing (e.g., there is no house, tree, or person).

Respond in **exactly this numbered format**, one per line:

1. Hands missing, cut off, or extremely small (look for incomplete limbs, tiny hands, or unnatural truncation): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
2. Arms disproportionately large or drawn in an aggressive pose (raised fists, weapons, tension): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
3. Neck missing or head detached from body (floating or disconnected head): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
4. Legs tightly closed or crossed in an unnatural, stiff, or defensive way: <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
5. Genitalia explicitly shown, emphasized, or symbolically suggested (focus, shading, or detail): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
6. Face sad, crying, or missing key features (no eyes/mouth or downturned features): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
7. Mouth sealed, sewn, or missing entirely (no visible line or intentionally crossed/covered): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
8. Ears exaggerated, abnormally large, or emphasized: <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
9. House missing doors or windows (incomplete or closed structure): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
10. Dark clouds, heavy rain, or bars on house/tree suggesting confinement or sadness: <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
11. Trees without roots or drawn abnormally small/weak compared to other elements: <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
12. Phallic or sexually suggestive shapes (elongated wedges, cylindrical objects, or pointed weapons): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
13. Excessive dominance of dark tones (red, black, or brown covering large areas): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
14. Repetitive emotional symbols (multiple hearts, tears, sad faces, emojis): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>  
15. Isolation theme (single person alone, separated, or distant from others/objects): <YES/NO/UNCLEAR/SKIP>
